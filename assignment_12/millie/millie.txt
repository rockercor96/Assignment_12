Hi! My name is Millie.

Someone in my family was allergic to me, so I came to Animal Humane Society to find a new home.

People describe me as shy. Shy cats are loving companions that take longer to acclimate to a new environment. A quieter, low-activity home would allow me the opportunity to get used to new things at my own pace.

People also describe me as independent. Independent cats love to explore their surroundings and need plenty of toys and activity to keep them busy and engaged. We tend not to be demanding for cuddles & kisses and mostly enjoy hanging out with you and being a part of your daily activities. Families with older children are especially suitable for cats like me.
